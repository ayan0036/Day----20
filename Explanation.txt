 Angular is a front-end web development framework developed by Google, which is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) using TypeScript. It follows a component-based architecture where the UI is divided into reusable components. Angular comes with powerful features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and built-in routing which make application development structured and scalable. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps automate common tasks like creating projects, generating components, running servers, and building production-ready applications efficiently.
